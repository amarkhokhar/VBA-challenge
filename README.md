# VBA-challenge
This is a repository for my vba challenge files that holds the screenshots and the vba script.

Attached is my homework for the stock analysis and the additional screenshots that show my results.

For this assignment, I did receive outside assistance in order to complete the assignment. I used stackoverlfow to find functions, such as Worksheetfunction.max and worksheetfunction.min to figure out how to find the minimum and maximum values within my percent change column. Additionally, I used the learning assistant tool on uci dashboard to find the worksheetfunction.match to find the row index of the max and min values so I could then grab the ticker for the max volume and percent change and min percent change. I also used stackover flow to figure out the for loop for the entire workbook and to loop my code throughout the entire workbook. Slack team channel was used to get insight on the formula needed to find the maximum value.
